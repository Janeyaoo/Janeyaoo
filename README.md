- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Janeyaooï¼Œa second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and BIMSA.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in topological Network resilienceï¼Œtopological data analysisï¼Œpersistence homology application.
- ðŸŒ± I am working on integrating topological information into the framework for addressing network dismantling and related combinatorial optimization problems.
- ðŸ’ž I am exploring the training of diffusion models integrated with topological data analysis to approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems such as the TSP and NDP.
